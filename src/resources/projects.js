        "description": " Designed an 11 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) Bionic Arm, meticulously crafted to be controlled via an intricate system of 4 EMG Sensor bands. The primary objective was to empower individuals with lower elbow amputations, providing them with vital support to enhance their mobility and functionality. Additionally, a range of Machine Learning models were deployed for comprehensive dataset analysis, leading to the development of a robust ML model. Through rigorous training and testing, this model successfully identified three distinct hand gestures with remarkable precision, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 94.18%. The project's success was underscored by its recognition, securing the prestigious 1st place in the College Project Competition. ",
